This tool writes a songs.txt file for HOI3 in a specified folder. It is written in Python and can be converted to an executable using auto-py-to-exe. 

It's incredibly bare but it should be simple enough to use. It reads every file in inputed directory and adds the file name of files ending in .mp3 into songs.txt. It also removes 'Hearts of Iron IV Soundtrack - ' and all whitespace in the file name. 

## **THIS TOOL WILL RENAME YOUR FILES, PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS.**
